## Day 0 : 14 October , 2024

I commited my self to do the #100daysofcodechallange to learn **DSA** and become a **Redcoder in Competitive Programming** .
I have 4 goals in my mind:
1. Learning Data Structures and Algorithms (theoretical and coding part)
2. Become a Redcoder in Competitive Programming. (codeforces and codechef)
3. Solving Leetcode questions and giving regular contests. (more than 150 questions)
4. Making Projects with HTML, CSS ,JS.
So, I made an public commitment in [x/twitter](https://x.com/MirzaMehedi1971) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirza-mehedi-hasan-a37a16263/). That I will continue my journey with you.
